                  Fintra may provide
                  <span class="font-bold">Margin Loan</span> facilities to
                  eligible Clients, allowing you to purchase securities on
                  margin by borrowing funds from Fintra. Margin trading can
                  <span class="font-bold">amplify both gains and losses</span>
                  and carries significant risk. The availability of margin loans
                  is subject to strict regulatory guidelines and Fintra’s
                  internal credit policies. Key terms of the margin facility
                  include:

                    <span class="font-bold">Eligibility for Margin:</span> Not
                    all Clients or transactions qualify for margin financing.
                    Fintra will determine eligibility based on BSEC’s margin
                    rules and Fintra’s risk assessment. For example, BSEC’s
                    guidelines may require that a Client have a minimum equity
                    investment amount and a regular income to qualify for
                    margin. Fintra may require you to have maintained a minimum
                    account balance (e.g., at least BDT 500,000 in investments,
                    as per applicable regulations) and a minimum trading
                    experience (such as one year) before approving a margin
                    account. We may also require you to sign a separate Margin
                    Agreement detailing specific terms.

                  <li>
                    <span class="font-bold">Marginable Securities:</span> Not
                    all securities can be bought on margin. Fintra will maintain
                    a list of eligible securities as per BSEC rules (for
                    instance, margin loans might be disallowed for certain
                    categories of stocks or newly listed securities until they
                    meet criteria). You are responsible for ensuring that a
                    security is margin-eligible before executing a margin trade.
                    If you attempt to use margin for an ineligible security,
                    Fintra may reject the order or treat it as a cash
                    (non-margin) order.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When you purchase securities on margin, you must provide
                    collateral (cash or securities in your account) to secure
                    the loan. Fintra will typically finance a portion of the
                    purchase, and you must contribute the rest as equity. The
                    ratio of loan to equity (margin requirement) will be
                    determined by Fintra within regulatory limits (e.g.,
                    regulators may cap margin loans to a certain percentage of
                    the portfolio value). Fintra will inform you of the initial
                    margin requirement for each transaction and the
                    <span class="font-bold">maintenance margin </span> you must
                    uphold.
                    <span class="font-bold"
                      >You must maintain a sufficient level of equity in your
                      account; if the value of your portfolio falls, Fintra may
                      require you to deposit additional funds or sell assets to
                      maintain the required margin (a “margin call”)</span
                    >. For instance, regulatory draft rules suggest that if a
                    portfolio’s value falls to 175% of the loan value, a margin
                    call is triggered, and if it falls below 150%, a forced sale
                    must occur to protect against further loss. While specific
                    thresholds may vary, Fintra will generally issue a margin
                    call notification if your equity falls below the maintenance
                    requirement. You agree to promptly meet any margin calls by
                    depositing additional collateral as needed.

                    Borrowing on margin incurs interest and possibly other
                    charges. The interest rate and method of calculation for
                    margin loans will be communicated to you (for example, a
                    daily or annual interest rate on the borrowed amount, which
                    may accrue daily and be charged to your account monthly).
                    Fintra reserves the right to change the interest rate and
                    will notify you of any changes as required by law or in your
                    Margin Agreement. You agree to pay all interest and
                    associated charges for margin usage. If interest or charges
                    remain unpaid, they will be added to your outstanding loan
                    balance, and

                    loan transactions) as applicable.

                    since you are trading with borrowed funds. Market conditions
                    can change rapidly and you may not have the opportunity to
                    deposit additional funds before Fintra acts to protect its
                    interests (and by extension, your account’s solvency).
                    Fintra’s enforcement of margin requirements (including
                    forced liquidation) is to comply with regulatory obligations
                    and to prevent the account from falling into a negative

                <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                  Fintra may offer
                  <span class="font-bold">Bridging Loans</span> as a short-term
                  credit facility to bridge gaps in settlement or to facilitate
                  certain time-sensitive transactions for Clients. Bridging
                  loans are typically of short duration and are intended to be
                  repaid from predictable incoming funds (for example, to
                  provide you funds immediately upon selling securities, rather
                  than waiting for the T+2 settlement, or to allow you to make a
                  time-sensitive investment pending liquidation of another
                  asset). The following outlines the bridging loan service:

                    <span class="font-bold">Use Cases:</span> Bridging loans can
                    be used to

                      >bridge settlement timing differences</span
                    >
                    or meet short-term liquidity needs related to trading. For
                    instance, if you sell shares and need the proceeds
                    immediately (before the standard settlement completes), a
                    bridging loan might advance a portion of the sale proceeds.
                    Alternatively, if you have applied for an IPO or need to pay
                    for a purchase but your funds are tied up for a few days, a
                    bridging loan might cover the interim period. Fintra will
                    specify the approved purposes for any bridging loan and may
                    require documentation of the pending funds it is bridging.

                    <span class="font-bold">Term and Repayment:</span> Bridging
                    loans are <span class="font-bold">short-term</span> by
                    nature, often requiring repayment within a very brief period
                    (such as within a few days or weeks, or upon the occurrence
                    of a specified event like settlement completion). The loan
                    will typically be automatically repaid from the incoming
                    funds it is bridging. For example, if bridging a stock sale,
                    the loan plus interest may be automatically deducted from
                    the sale proceeds once settlement occurs and the funds
                    arrive. If the expected funds do not materialize (e.g., a
                    sale fails or an expected payment is delayed or canceled),
                    you are still fully responsible for repaying the bridging
                    loan from your own resources by the due date.

                  <li>
                    <span class="font-bold">Interest and Fees:</span> Bridging
                    loans generally carry interest or fees which may be higher
                    (on an annualized basis) than standard loans, given their
                    short tenure. Fintra will disclose the interest rate (which
                    may be a fixed fee for the period or a daily interest rate)
                    before you accept the loan. Interest may be calculated on a
                    daily basis for the number of days the loan is outstanding.
                    There may also be processing fees or administrative charges.
                    You agree to pay all interest and fees as specified. If you
                    repay early, interest may still be charged for a minimum
                    period as per the loan terms (if applicable). If you fail to
                    repay on time, penalty interest rates or late fees may
                    apply, and Fintra may exercise rights against any collateral
                    (e.g., securities in your account) to recover the dues.

                    <span class="font-bold">Security and Collateral:</span> A
                    bridging loan will typically be secured against the assets
                    or funds that are expected to come in or other assets in
                    your trading account. By accepting a bridging loan, you
                    grant Fintra the right to lien or hold such collateral. For
                    example, if you take a bridging loan expecting funds from a
                    share sale, the shares sold (or the sale receivable) or
                    other holdings in your account may serve as collateral.
                    Fintra may refrain from releasing certain securities or
                    funds to you (even if otherwise withdrawable) if they are
                    earmarked for a bridging loan repayment.

                    <span class="font-bold">Default on Bridging Loan:</span>
                    If you do not repay a bridging loan by the agreed time (for
                    instance, if the anticipated incoming funds do not cover it
                    and you do not cover the shortfall), Fintra will consider
                    this a default. In such event,

                      >Fintra is entitled to take necessary actions to recover

                    , including but not limited to liquidating securities or
                    other assets in your account to cover the owed amount
                    (similar to a margin liquidation) and/or taking legal action
                    for debt recovery. You will be responsible for any shortfall
                    after liquidation, as well as any costs associated with
                    collection.

                    <span class="font-bold"> Availability and Discretion:</span>
                    Bridging loans are offered at Fintra’s discretion and are
                    not a guaranteed service. We assess each request or
                    transaction on a case-by-case basis. Fintra reserves the
                    right to decline to offer a bridging loan to you, or to
                    specify a lower amount than requested, based on our risk
                    assessment and prevailing regulatory or internal limits. We
                    may also suspend or discontinue the bridging loan facility
                    entirely at any time. Future availability of bridging loans
                    could depend on regulatory permissions and Fintra’s business
                    decisions.

                    By using a bridging loan, you acknowledge that it is your
                    responsibility to ensure the anticipated funds or liquidity
                    event will occur. Any risk that the expected funds might be
                    delayed or fail to arrive lies with you. You should have a
                    backup plan to repay the loan if the primary source fails.
                    Fintra’s provision of a bridging loan does not in any way
                    guarantee or make Fintra responsible for the underlying
                    transaction (e.g., if an issuer fails to deliver IPO refund
                    money or if a buyer fails to pay for a sale – those are
                    outside Fintra’s control).

You may <span class="font-bold">not use the service for any illegal, fraudulent, or unauthorized purpose</span>, including but not limited to money laundering, terrorist financing, insider trading, market manipulation, abusive trading practices, or misrepresentation of identity. The account is provided for your personal (or your organization’s internal) use only.
                You shall not allow any other person to use your account or identity to access Fintra’s services, and you will not use any other person’s account.

                <span class="font-bold">6.2 Compliance with Rules:</span> You must follow all rules established by regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations applicable to trading. This includes BSEC regulations, DSE/CSE trading regulations, and CDBL depository rules. For example, you agree not to engage in activities like circular trading, spoofing, layering, or any act that could be considered market manipulation or a violation of fair trading norms. If you are an insider or connected person for any listed company, you acknowledge the obligation to refrain from trading during restricted periods and to make any required disclosures as per law. Fintra may monitor trading patterns for compliance and reserves the right to report any suspicious activities to BSEC, the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU), or other appropriate authorities as required.

Fintra relies on the information provided by you to service your account and to comply with regulatory reporting (such as proper tax identification and withholding). Any incorrect or outdated information could lead to service disruptions or compliance issues for which you would be responsible.

Failure to pay on time could result in Fintra selling out the purchased securities (<span class="font-bold">“autoforce sell”</span> for settlement failure) and charging you any consequential loss. Similarly, if you place a sell order, you must ensure the securities are available/transferable in your BO account for delivery; failure to deliver securities could cause Fintra to purchase the equivalent securities from the market to cover the short position, and you would be liable for any difference in cost and penalties. You are responsible for all <span class="font-bold">fees, commissions, taxes, and charges</span> related to your trading and use of services as detailed in Section 7.

Fintra will not be responsible for data or orders transmitted through any third-party tool that you use at your own risk.

                <span class="font-bold">7.1 Brokerage Commission:</span> By using Fintra’s brokerage services, you agree to pay brokerage commissions on your trades. The commission rate will be as per Fintra’s schedule or as mandated by BSEC/DSE regulations. Currently, brokerage commission rates are subject to BSEC-set caps and industry standards. Fintra’s commission may be a percentage of the transaction value or a fixed amount per trade, as disclosed to you. This commission is charged on both buy and sell transactions (unless specifically waived in promotions). <span class="font-bold">A schedule of our current fees is available on our website and within the app.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">7.2 Exchange and Depository Fees:</span> In addition to Fintra’s own commission, certain fees imposed by the exchange and depository will be passed through to you. These include, for example, DSE/CSE trading fees, CDBL charges for settlement, and any clearing fees. When you trade, these fees are added to your cost (for purchases) or deducted from your proceeds (for sales). Fintra will itemize these in contract notes or statements where possible. You agree to pay all such statutory or regulatory fees, which may change from time to time. <span class="font-bold">For reference, you may incur DSE transaction fees and CDBL fees on each trade.</span> Government charges like stamp duty on share transfers may also apply.
              </p>
              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">7.3 Margin and Loan Charges:</span> If you utilize margin loans or bridging loans (Sections 5.3 and 5.4), you will incur interest and possibly other charges as described earlier. These costs will either be debited from your account or included in the loan balance, as per the arrangement. Interest rates for margin/bridging loans will be communicated and are subject to change with notice. You should review the specific loan agreement or disclosure for details. <span class="font-bold">All applicable interest, service charges, and processing fees for such facilities must be paid by you;</span> otherwise, they will accrue and your obligations will increase accordingly.
              </p>

                <span class="font-bold">7.4 Other Account Service Fees:</span> Fintra may charge fees for certain ancillary services, such as: account maintenance fees, annual fees for BO accounts, withdrawal or fund transfer fees (if any beyond direct costs), fees for dishonored payments (e.g., bounced cheques or failed direct debits), or fees for additional statements or certificate issuance. Fintra will maintain a fee schedule that outlines these potential charges. For example, if Fintra provides SMS alert services or real-time data subscriptions, there might be subscription fees, which will be clearly informed to you before activation.

                <span class="font-bold">7.5 Payment of Fees:</span> You authorize Fintra to deduct any fees, charges, commissions, interest, or taxes you owe from your account balance. We may deduct amounts from any cash in your trading account or from any credits due to you (such as sale proceeds or dividends). If your account does not have sufficient cash, we may sell some of your securities to cover the charges, after providing notice if required by regulation. In case any fees remain unpaid (e.g., a debit balance arises), that amount will be treated as a debt you owe us, and Fintra reserves the right to take necessary action to collect it (which could include legal action or involving a collections agency, and reporting the delinquency to the regulator or credit bureaus if applicable).

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">7.6 Taxes:</span> All fees and charges are generally quoted exclusive of any applicable taxes (unless specified). If any Value Added Tax (VAT), financial transaction tax, or any other tax is applicable to the fees or to transactions, you agree to pay such taxes. For instance, under Bangladeshi law, VAT may be levied on brokerage commissions or certain service fees. Fintra will collect such taxes and remit them to the government as required. We will reflect tax deductions in your statements. Additionally, certain taxes like capital gains tax or taxes on dividend income might be withheld at source as per law — Fintra will deduct and deposit such taxes as required, and the net amount will be credited to your account.

                <span class="font-bold">7.7 Changes to Fees:</span> Fintra reserves the right to change its fee structure or introduce new fees with at least such notice as is required by law or regulation. We will notify you of fee changes through the app, website, or email. If you continue to use the services after the fee change takes effect, that constitutes your acceptance of the new fees. If you object to any fee change, you may cease using the service and close your account in accordance with Section 15, subject to settling any outstanding obligations.

                <span class="font-bold">7.8 No Refund Policy:</span> Generally, fees, commissions, and charges once incurred are non-refundable. For example, if a trade is executed and later canceled or amended due to any reason, the fees for the original execution may still be payable (though Fintra will follow exchange rules regarding any fee adjustments for canceled trades). If you believe an incorrect fee has been charged, you must notify Fintra promptly and we will review the matter. Any agreed refund or adjustment will be at Fintra’s discretion or as mandated by rules.

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300">
                <span class="font-bold">8.1 Funding Your Account:</span> To trade or use certain services, you need to deposit funds into your Fintra trading account. Fintra supports multiple payment methods for depositing Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) funds, including <span class="font-bold">bank transfers, bKash (mobile wallet) payments</span>, and other payment gateways or services as made available. Deposits must originate from an account or source in your own name – <span class="font-bold">we do not accept third-party payments</span> for your account, in order to comply with AML regulations. When you initiate a deposit, you must follow the instructions provided (e.g. using your unique client reference when transferring to our designated bank account, or using the in-app bKash integration to push funds). Fintra will credit your trading account after confirming receipt of funds. Credit for trading might be given only after funds have cleared (for bank transfers) or immediately for real-time methods like bKash, subject to hold as described below.
              </p>
              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">8.2 bKash and Mobile Payments:</span> If you use <span class="font-bold">bKash</span> to deposit funds, you agree to the terms and procedures of bKash’s payment service. <span class="font-bold">bKash acts solely as a payment method and is not responsible for the delivery of Fintra’s services.</span> Fintra integrates bKash’s payment gateway for your convenience. When you make a payment via bKash, the funds may be subject to bKash’s processing. In some cases, bKash or Fintra might hold the payment in a pending state until certain confirmations are completed. For example, if there’s a need to verify the availability of funds or to prevent fraud, the credit to your account might not be instantaneous. <span class="font-bold">If a deposit via bKash is held or delayed, Fintra is not liable for any trading opportunity loss or inconvenience</span> because the funding was not available yet. In the event a payment is not completed or is reversed by bKash (for instance, if you did not confirm the transaction or if bKash’s system failed), Fintra will not credit your account and is not responsible for any consequences of non-payment. You should contact bKash customer care for issues specific to the payment processing (dial 16247 or relevant support), though Fintra will assist to the extent possible in reconciling transactions.
              </p>
              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">8.3 Withdrawal of Funds:</span> You may request to withdraw available cash funds from your Fintra account at any time, subject to settlement periods and any hold on funds. Withdrawals will generally be processed via the same route as deposits: e.g., to your linked bank account or to your bKash wallet, as per your instruction (Fintra may restrict withdrawals to verified accounts in your name only, to prevent third-party transfers). Fintra will attempt to process withdrawal requests promptly; however, <span class="font-bold">we do not guarantee immediate withdrawal as processing times can depend on banking hours, bKash processing, or additional verification if needed.</span> Typically, if you sell securities, the sale proceeds are only withdrawable after the settlement date (T+2 days for equities, or as per exchange rules). If you have recently deposited funds, Fintra may hold withdrawals until the deposit is cleared or not subject to reversal (this could be a few banking days, especially for large transfers or first-time deposits).
              </p>
              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">8.4 Withdrawal Limits and Procedures:</span> Fintra may set daily or per-transaction limits on withdrawals for security or regulatory reasons. For example, there might be a maximum amount you can withdraw via bKash in a single transaction or per day in line with bKash limits. If you need to withdraw a large amount, a bank transfer might be required. We may also require additional identity verification for large withdrawals or unusual withdrawal requests (as part of fraud prevention). Fintra reserves the right to refuse or delay a withdrawal request if we suspect unauthorized activity or if your account is under review. We will inform you if any additional steps are needed. You are responsible for any fees charged by third-party institutions on withdrawals (Fintra itself may not charge a withdrawal fee, but your bank or bKash might impose a fee which is typically borne by the sender/receiver as per their policy).

                <span class="font-bold">8.5 Segregation of Client Funds:</span> Fintra will maintain client funds (your deposits) in a segregated account as required by BSEC regulations. This means your money is kept separate from Fintra’s own corporate funds. However, note that the funds may be co-mingled in one or more client omnibus accounts (with proper records of each client’s balance) as per common practice, but they are not used for Fintra’s operating purposes. Fintra does not pay interest on any cash balances in your trading account, unless explicitly stated or required by law.

                <span class="font-bold">8.6 Errors and Reversals:</span> If we credit your account in error (for example, a duplicate deposit, or a bank reversal after we gave credit), we reserve the right to reverse those credits. You authorize Fintra to deduct any such erroneously credited amounts from your account, or, if insufficient, you agree to repay the outstanding amount immediately upon notice. Conversely, if a deposit you made does not reflect, and it’s due to a mistake on Fintra’s part, we will correct it and credit your account with the appropriate value date if feasible.
              </p>
              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">8.7 Payment Disputes:</span> If you believe there has been an error in processing any deposit or withdrawal, you must contact Fintra promptly (and in any case, within 7 days of the date of the transaction in question). We will investigate and attempt to resolve the issue. If the error is on Fintra’s side, we will rectify it; if the issue lies with a third-party (e.g., the bank or bKash), it may take additional time to liaise with them. Fintra’s liability for any payment error will be limited – for instance, if a withdrawal is delayed due to Fintra’s fault, our liability will not exceed restoring the funds to you or completing the transaction; <span class="font-bold">we will not be responsible for indirect consequences, such as lost interest or missed investment opportunities, due to payment delays.</span>

                <span class="font-bold">8.8 Integration with Other Payment Services:</span> Fintra may integrate or support additional payment services in the future (such as other Mobile Financial Services, payment gateways, credit/debit card payments for account funding, etc.). Use of any such method implies your agreement to the terms and conditions of those service providers, in addition to these Terms. Fintra will not be responsible for failures on part of those services. For example, if in future a service like <span class="font-bold">Nagad</span> or bank EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) is supported, any issues or delays on the banking network’s side are beyond Fintra’s control.

Fintra may impose deposit or withdrawal limits if needed to comply with AML laws (for example, we might ask questions about the source of a very large deposit or require evidence of the destination for a large withdrawal). We appreciate your cooperation in keeping the financial system secure.

                <span class="font-bold">13.1 Exclusion of Certain Damages: To the maximum extent permitted by applicable

                for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages</span> whatsoever, 
                arising out of or in connection with your use of (or inability to use) any Fintra service or 
                these Terms. This exclusion applies regardless of the cause of action (whether in 
                contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other theory). Such excluded 
                damages include, but are not limited to: <span class="font-bold">lost profits, lost or delayed trading 
                opportunities, loss of revenue, loss of data, trading losses, loss of goodwill, or the cost

                the platform was unavailable or slow at a moment you intended to execute a trade and 
                you claim a missed opportunity. - Fintra is not liable for losses due to market 
                movements, even if those movements were exacerbated by a forced sale or technical 
                glitch. - If unauthorized access to your account occurs (e.g., through hacking or your 
                own credential compromise) and results in loss, our liability is limited as per this 
                Section and Section 3.5, unless law states otherwise. - Fintra will not be liable for 
                consequential effects of any service suspension, termination, or changes as described 
                in these Terms.

During suspension, you may be unable to execute trades, withdraw funds, or access the account.

                <span class="font-bold"> - Breach:</span> If you materially breach these Terms or other agreements with Fintra and fail to rectify the breach within any reasonable timeframe specified by us (if the breach is rectifiable).<span class="font-bold"> - Prolonged Inactivity:</span> If your account remains inactive (no logins or transactions) for a very long period (e.g., 12+ months) and has a zero balance, we may close the account after notice. (Accounts with assets won’t be closed without exhausting efforts to contact you or escheatment procedures as per law.)
                <span class="font-bold"> - Regulatory Requirement:</span> If laws change or regulatory actions require Fintra to cease providing services to you (for example, if you move to a jurisdiction where we’re not permitted to offer service, or if BSEC revokes our ability to service you).<span class="font-bold"> - Business Decision:</span> If Fintra decides to discontinue offering the brokerage services entirely or in your jurisdiction (e.g., Fintra exits the business or merges). In such cases, we will give you advance notice to withdraw assets or transfer to another broker.<span class="font-bold"> - Risk/Abuse:</span> If we determine that continuing our relationship with you exposes us to undue risk or brand damage (e.g., if you are found engaging in fraud, abusive behavior towards our staff, or other misconduct).
                When Fintra terminates an account, we will lift any suspension to allow you to withdraw any remaining eligible funds or securities (except to the extent they may be held or frozen due to disputes or legal reasons). You will be given instructions on how to transfer your securities (e.g., transferring your BO account to another broker) and withdraw your cash. If you do not act within the time specified in the notice, Fintra may take steps to return assets via cheque to your address on file, or as per regulatory guidance (for instance, unclaimed assets might be transferred to a government-designated fund after a certain time as per law).

Upon receiving your request, Fintra will guide you to withdraw any remaining cash and transfer out or sell any securities. Note that closing your account will not affect any rights or obligations accrued prior to closure. <span class="font-bold">Any provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination (such as indemnities, limitation of liability, outstanding payment obligations, dispute resolution clauses, etc.) will survive</span> the closure of your account.

Fintra will not be liable to you for any losses resulting directly from the closure of positions due to account termination (for instance, if we sell your securities at prevailing market price during termination because you did not transfer them out). We will send you a closing statement reflecting the disposition of assets.

Dormant accounts might be subject to additional verification upon reactivation. Fintra will attempt to reach out via last known contact details. If required by law, unclaimed assets in dormant accounts may eventually be reported or remitted to a government authority after a prescribed dormancy period – we will comply with such laws while attempting to protect your rights.

For example, if you executed a trade and then your account was terminated, you are still entitled to receive the securities or proceeds of that trade, or conversely still obligated to settle it.

                <span class="font-bold">15.8 Suspension of Specific Services:</span> Instead of full account suspension, Fintra may suspend specific services or features. For example, Fintra could suspend your margin facility (requiring you to operate on cash-only basis) without suspending overall trading, if you breach margin terms but otherwise behave well. Similarly, Fintra might disable the use of certain payment methods for you if issues are detected, etc. The terms of suspension can vary case by case.

We will review your appeal in good faith, but our determination will be final. If a suspension is lifted as a result, you will regain access per our instructions.

If any new service terms conflict with these Terms, the specific terms for the new service will govern for that service to the extent of the conflict.
              </p>

                <span class="font-bold">16.3 Discontinuation of Features:</span> Fintra’s right to discontinue features also extends to the above new services. For example, if Fintra launches a loyalty program as a trial, we may later decide to modify or withdraw it. Similarly, if an educational tool is not widely used, we might remove it or replace it. If an advisory service is introduced but later regulatory environment changes, we might suspend it. We will not be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such offerings, except to ensure that any of your vested benefits or funds tied up in the feature are appropriately handled (for instance, if we were to discontinue a particular savings or interest feature, any funds of yours in that feature would be returned to your main account).

                <span class="font-bold">16.4 Updates and Software Changes:</span> Fintra may deploy changes to its user interface, trading engine, order types, or other software components. These changes could alter the user experience. We may add or remove support for certain device platforms or operating systems. Users are expected to stay updated with the latest version of the application for optimal security and performance. If a change materially alters how you use the service (for instance, a new order type or a new layout), we may provide a tutorial or guide, but it is ultimately your responsibility to familiarize yourself with updated functionalities. We will not be responsible for losses that occur due to unawareness of a modified process when we have reasonably notified users or provided documentation.

                <span class="font-bold">16.5 Temporary Features:</span> Some features might be launched in <span class="font-bold">beta or promotional phase</span> (e.g., a limited-time zero commission trading offer, or a beta test of a new charting tool). These can be changed into paid features or removed after the trial. Fintra is not obligated to continue a feature at a particular price or free forever unless explicitly promised. We also reserve the right to charge fees for new features or services that were initially free, with appropriate notice to you. (For example, if we introduce an advanced analytics suite free for a year, we may later include it as part of a premium subscription).

                <span class="font-bold">16.6 Service Limits:</span> Fintra may impose limits on certain features (e.g., number of watchlists you can create, number of API calls if we provide an API, etc.) and can change those limits. Such modifications are in place to ensure the stability and fairness of use among all users.
              </p>

                <span class="font-bold">16.7 Communication of Changes:</span> Any significant changes to services or introduction/discontinuation of features will be communicated through one or more channels: posting on our website, in-app notifications, and/or email to your registered address. <span class="font-bold">We will notify you of any major changes through the app, our website, or via email</span>. It is important that you keep your contact information up to date to receive such notices.

                <span class="font-bold">16.8 Client’s Recourse:</span> If you are dissatisfied with a modification or discontinuation of a service, your sole recourse may be to cease using that service or close your account. Fintra will not be liable for compensation due to changes in business offerings, as this is an inherent aspect of the technology and financial service industry.

                <span class="font-bold">17.1 Right to Amend:</span> Fintra has the right to amend, update, or change these Terms at any time. As our business and regulatory environment evolves, we may need to make changes to reflect new services, new laws, or new conditions. <span class="font-bold">Mika Securities’ terms explicitly note they reserve the right to amend terms at any time, and similarly Fintra reserves such right.</span> Any amendment will become effective once the updated Terms are posted on our website or otherwise communicated to you, unless otherwise specified by Fintra.

                <span class="font-bold">17.2 Notification of Changes:</span> When we update these Terms, we will take appropriate measures to inform you. This may include:
              
                 - Posting the revised Terms on Fintra’s website or app (with a new “Last Updated” date).
                - Sending an email to your registered email address summarizing the changes or indicating that terms have changed.
                - Providing a notification upon login requiring you to review the new Terms.
                For material changes (those that affect your rights or obligations significantly), we will endeavor to give advance notice if feasible. Minor changes (clarifications, typographical corrections, enhancements that do not negatively impact user rights) may be made with or without direct notice, by posting the updated Terms.
              </p>

                <span class="font-bold">17.3 Acceptance of Changes:</span> After we update the Terms, <span class="font-bold">your continued use of Fintra’s services will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms.</span> If you do not agree with the changes, you must cease using the services and may terminate your account as per Section 15. Always review notices of changes carefully. If required by law, we might obtain your explicit agreement for certain types of material changes (for example, if a change involves a new consent for data use, or introducing arbitration clause, etc. in jurisdictions requiring opt-in).

                <span class="font-bold">17.4 Regulatory Changes:</span> In some cases, changes to these Terms may be driven by new laws or directives by regulatory authorities. Such changes might need to be implemented on short notice to ensure compliance. Fintra’s compliance with law will take precedence – if any provision of these Terms is required to change to conform to law, it can be changed effective immediately, with retrospective effect if necessary/mandated.
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">17.5 Historic Versions:</span> For transparency, Fintra may maintain archives of previous versions of these Terms. You have the right to request a copy of prior terms you agreed to, if needed for reference. However, the latest version will govern the relationship going forward.
              </p>

                <span class="font-bold">17.6 No Oral Amendments:</span> Any amendment to these Terms must be made by Fintra through the formal process described. Fintra employees or agents (e.g., customer support staff) are not authorized to modify the Terms via oral or email statements. If you believe you have an arrangement with Fintra that alters these standard Terms, it must be documented in a written agreement signed by an authorized officer of Fintra.

                <span class="font-bold">17.7 Severability and Conflict:</span> If any changes to Terms conflict with earlier provisions or other documents, the most current Terms (or any specifically negotiated agreement you have with Fintra) will prevail. If any part of the updated Terms is declared invalid, the rest remains enforceable as detailed later in Section 20.2.

              </h2>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300">
                <span class="font-bold">18.1 Governing Law:</span> These Terms and any disputes arising under or related to these Terms or the use of Fintra’s services will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the <span class="font-bold">People’s Republic of Bangladesh, without regard to its conflict of laws principles</span>. The governing law clause means Bangladeshi law will apply to interpret this contract and to adjudicate any disputes, even if you access the services from outside Bangladesh (noting that Fintra primarily serves the Bangladesh market). If you are using the services from another jurisdiction, you are responsible for compliance with local laws, but the agreement between you and Fintra remains under Bangladesh law.
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">18.2 Jurisdiction:</span> You agree that any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including any question regarding their existence, validity, or termination, shall be subject to the <span class="font-bold">exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Bangladesh</span><u>[43]</u>. Typically, major legal actions will be brought in the courts of <span class="font-bold">Dhaka, Bangladesh</span>, given that is where Fintra’s headquarters and principal operations are located, unless otherwise required by law. By agreeing to these Terms, you waive any objection to the venue and jurisdiction of these courts on the grounds of inconvenience or otherwise.
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">18.3 Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR):</span> Fintra may encourage resolving disputes amicably. <span class="font-bold">We and you agree to attempt to resolve disputes or grievances through good faith negotiations or mediation before resorting to litigation<u>[44]</u></span>. If a dispute arises, the complaining party should notify the other in writing, summarizing the issue and desired remedy. The parties shall then attempt to negotiate in good faith. If those negotiations do not resolve the 
                matter, they might consider mediation by a neutral third-party in Dhaka (if both sides agree). <span class="font-bold">However, this clause does not preclude either party from seeking immediate injunctive relief from a court if necessary to prevent significant harm. (for example, if you 
                misappropriate our intellectual property or we need to freeze an account due to legal order, 
                etc.)</span>
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">18.4 Investor Complaint and Arbitration (if any):</span> The Bangladesh Securities and Exchange 
                Commission and stock exchanges may have an investor complaint resolution forum. For 
                instance, DSE has an Investor Complaint cell and an Arbitration mechanism for broker-client 
                disputes. If such a mechanism is available and applicable to your case, you may opt to use it. 
                Fintra will abide by the dispute resolution mechanisms mandated by BSEC and exchanges. Some 
                disputes (especially relating to trades, settlements) might be resolved through DSE’s arbitration 
                as per their regulations. Utilizing an exchange’s arbitration or dispute resolution forum does not 
                waive your right to go to court, but the decisions from such forums may be binding as per the 
                regulations you agreed to when opening a BO account and trading (commonly, the BO account 
                opening forms incorporate clauses about dispute resolution via the exchange). You should refer 
                to your BO account Terms or consult with us if you have a question on this. 
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">18.5 Legal Fees and Costs:</span> In any litigation or arbitration between you and Fintra, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs (including court fees, arbitration fees) from the other party. This discourages frivolous claims by ensuring the losing party bears the financial burden of dispute resolution.
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">18.6 Time Limit to Bring Claims:</span> To the extent permitted by law, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the use of Fintra’s services or these Terms must be filed within <span class="font-bold">one (1) year</span> after such claim or cause of action arose, or be forever barred. (For example, if there was an 
unauthorized trade on your account on January 1, 2025 and you discovered it then, any claim 
relating to it should be brought by January 1, 2026.)

                <span class="font-bold">18.7 Waiver of Jury Trial (if applicable):</span> As an extension of the jurisdiction clause, and to the extent allowed by Bangladeshi law, if there were to be a judicial proceeding, both parties knowingly waive any right to a trial by jury, ensuring any case is decided by a judge.
              </p>

                19. Risk Disclosure and Acknowledgement
              </h2>
              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300">
                Trading in securities and using leveraged facilities involves significant risk. By using Fintra’s services, you acknowledge and agree to the following risk disclosures:
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">19.1 Market Risk:</span> The value of securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) is subject to market fluctuations. Prices can rise or fall rapidly and unpredictably. <span class="font-bold">There is no guarantee that you will make a profit on your investments; you may incur losses, including possibly losing your entire principal.</span> Past performance of any security or the market is not indicative of future results.
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">19.2 Volatility and Liquidity:</span> Some stocks or instruments may be very volatile or thinly traded. You may not be able to sell your holdings at your desired price or time due to lack of liquidity or trading halts. Sudden news or events (earnings reports, political events, regulatory changes) can lead to sharp price movements. You must be prepared for the possibility of sharp losses.
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">19.3 No Guaranteed Returns:</span> Fintra does not guarantee any profits or returns. Any suggestions of potential upside (through research tools or otherwise) are speculative. <span class="font-bold">Trading and investment carry risk, and there are no assurances of success.</span> Beware of anyone (inside or outside Fintra) making “get rich quick” claims; they are not sanctioned by Fintra.
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">19.4 Margin and Leverage Risks:</span> If you engage in margin trading or take loans: 
                - <span class="font-bold">Magnified Losses:</span> Margin amplifies both gains and losses. A small market movement against you can have a big impact on your equity. If the value of your securities falls, you may owe more money than you invested. 
                - <span class="font-bold">Margin Calls:</span> Fintra may issue margin calls that require you to add funds or sell assets on short notice. If you do not or cannot, <span class="font-bold">Fintra will liquidate positions and you are responsible for any remaining debt.</span> These liquidations could occur at unfavorable prices. 
                - <span class="font-bold">Interest and Costs:</span> Borrowing costs will reduce your returns (or increase losses). High interest over time can eat away profits. 
                - <span class="font-bold">Eligibility and Liquidation:</span> By using margin, you confirm you meet eligibility (e.g., sufficient experience and capital as per regulations) and accept that Fintra can liquidate without additional consent to protect loan integrity.
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">19.5 Systemic and Unsystematic Risk:</span> There are macro-level risks (recession, regulatory changes, war, etc.) that can affect the entire market or multiple asset classes. There are also company-specific risks (management failure, fraud, sector downturns). Diversification can mitigate some unsystematic risks but not all. Even diversified portfolios can lose value in broad market downturns.
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">19.6 Trading Systems Risk:</span> Using an electronic trading platform like Fintra carries technology-related risks: 
                - <span class="font-bold">Execution Risk:</span> Orders might not execute at the expected time or price due to latency, system outages, or market conditions (fast markets, gaps). 
                - <span class="font-bold">Connectivity Risk:</span> If you lose internet connectivity or the platform faces downtime, you may not be able to place or modify orders. You should have alternative ways to contact us (like phone broking as a backup if provided) in such cases. 
                - <span class="font-bold">Data Errors:</span> Market data displayed might lag or have errors. You should use caution especially in volatile conditions where prices move quickly. 
                - <span class="font-bold">Cybersecurity Risk:</span> Though Fintra secures its systems, no system is immune to hacking. A breach could, in worst case, impact your account (we mitigate heavily, but risk is theoretical). 
                - <span class="font-bold">Force Majeure:</span> Technical failures, communication failures, or other events (fire, natural disasters) could disrupt trading.
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">19.7 Regulatory and Political Risk:</span> Laws and regulations can change, potentially affecting your investments (e.g., a new tax on stock trades, or a sector being restricted). Political instability or government actions (like demonetization, changes in monetary policy) can influence the markets adversely.
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">19.8 Currency Risk:</span> If you are an investor dealing in instruments or companies that have currency exposure (for instance, a company earning in foreign currency), currency exchange rate fluctuations can impact values. For foreign investors using Fintra (if permitted), changes in currency exchange rates between your home currency and BDT will affect your actual returns.
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">19.9 Fraud/Scam Risk:</span> There is risk of fraudulent schemes in the market (pump-and-dump schemes, ponzi schemes disguised as stock tips, etc.). You should be wary of unsolicited advice or tips. Validate information through credible sources. Fintra’s platform may give you tools, but cannot prevent you from falling prey to external scams if you choose to follow them.
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">19.10 Fintra Platform Limitations:</span> Fintra strives to provide quality tools (e.g., stop-loss orders to manage risk, portfolio analytics to see exposure), but using them correctly is your responsibility. A stop-loss order is not guaranteed to execute exactly at the price set; if the market gaps down, you could sell at a much lower price. Similarly, our analytics may not account for all scenarios. Use all tools as aids, not guarantees.
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">19.11 Knowledge and Suitability:</span> By trading, you confirm that you understand the basics of the market and the particular securities you invest in. Some products might be more complex (if Fintra ever offers derivatives or otherwise). Ensure you only trade what you understand. Fintra generally does not assess suitability on each trade (unless required by law for certain products), so the onus is on you to ensure an investment is right for you.
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">19.12 No Protective Insurance:</span> Funds and securities in your Fintra account are not covered by any depositor insurance scheme (like bank deposits are). While your assets are held in your BO account at CDBL, which is segregated, if, for example, there is broker misconduct or insolvency, the recovery might depend on legal processes. There is an Investor Protection Fund maintained by exchanges for broker defaults, but it has limits. Understand that investing risk includes the small risk of intermediary failure.
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                <span class="font-bold">19.13 Communication Risks:</span> Instructions or communications you send to Fintra (via email, chat, etc.) may face delays or might not reach us. For urgent matters, always confirm we received and acknowledged. Fintra is not responsible for acting on instructions that we did not actually receive or were delayed in transit.
              </p>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mt-3">
                By acknowledging these risks, you confirm that <span class="font-bold">you are entering the market with eyes open to potential losses and are not relying on Fintra to prevent or warn you of all risks.</span> Fintra provides a gateway and tools, but <span class="font-bold">the decisions and the consequences are ultimately yours.</span> We encourage you to invest prudently, consider your risk tolerance, and invest only funds you can afford to risk.

                <span class="font-bold">20.1 Entire Agreement:</span> These Terms (along with any additional rules, policies, or agreements expressly incorporated by reference or provided to you in the context of specific services) constitute the <span class="font-bold">entire agreement</span> between you and Fintra regarding the services. It supersedes and replaces any prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements, or communications (whether oral or written) relating to the subject matter. You acknowledge that you have not relied on any statement, representation, or warranty that is not expressly set out in these Terms. (For instance, any assurances made by any Fintra sales or support personnel that contradict the Terms are not binding).

                <span class="font-bold">20.2 Severability:</span> If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable under applicable law by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be deemed severed (removed) to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. The parties shall endeavor in good faith to replace any invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid one that, to the extent possible, achieves the original business purpose and intent. For example, if a court finds the limitation of liability excessive in a certain scenario, it might enforce it to the extent it deems reasonable, and the rest of the Terms remain valid.

If Fintra overlooks a breach by you of these Terms, it does not mean we waive our rights to enforce that or any subsequent breach. Similarly, specific waiver of one condition does not mean waiver of any other.

During such force majeure events, our obligations shall be suspended to the extent and for the duration that the performance is affected. We will make reasonable efforts to resume full performance as soon as practicable and may implement disaster recovery plans where appropriate.

Any attempted assignment without consent will be null and void.

You and Fintra are <span class="font-bold">independent contractors</span>, and neither party is authorized to act as agent or bind the other party except as expressly stated in these Terms. For example, using our brokerage service does not make Fintra your agent in a fiduciary sense beyond executing your instructions (we act as your broker to the extent of executing trades, but we are not a trustee or advisor unless explicitly agreed).
