                    To Provide and Maintain Services: We process your personal information to 
open, operate, and maintain your brokerage account and any related accounts 
(such as margin loan accounts). This includes executing your buy/sell orders on 
the stock exchanges, facilitating research tools or content you request, providing 
you with real-time market data, and administering any loan or credit facilities 
(e.g., evaluating and extending margin loans or bridging loans for trade 
settlements). We also use your data to process deposits, withdrawals, and other 
transactions you initiate, and to generally ensure our services function as 
intended for you on our digital platforms.

                    Identity Verification and Security: Your information is used to verify your identity 
when you open an account and log in, in order to protect against unauthorized 
access and fraudulent activity. For example, we use your National ID or passport 
information to perform e-KYC verification (which may involve checking against 
government or authorized databases) and we may use your photo or biometric 
data to confirm you are the legitimate account holder. We also use personal and 
device information to implement security measures (such as two-factor 
authentication, monitoring login locations, and detecting unusual account 
activities) to safeguard your account and our systems.

                    Regulatory Compliance and Legal Obligations: As a regulated financial 
institution, FINTRA must comply with various legal requirements under 
Bangladeshi law. We process and retain personal data to fulfill our obligations 
under laws such as the Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969; the Money 
Laundering Prevention Act, 2012 (and related anti-financial crime regulations); 
the Cyber Security Act, 2023; and any rules or guidelines issued by BSEC, the 
Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), or other regulatory authorities. For example, we 
are required to collect certain KYC information at account opening, report large 
or suspicious transactions to the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU), 
maintain transaction records for a minimum period, and ensure confidentiality of 
client data. Your data may also be used to satisfy other legal obligations such as 
responding to lawful requests from government authorities or court orders.

notifications, margin call or loan-related notices, and updates on any changes to 
our terms or policies. We may also send service-related announcements (for 
instance, if our platform is undergoing maintenance, or in the event of any 
security incident). These communications are considered part of our service to 
you and you may not opt out of receiving them, as they are necessary for the 
management of your account.

                    Providing Research and Educational Content: If you subscribe to our research 
services or market insights, we will use your information to deliver newsletters, 
analysis reports, stock updates, and other research content to you. We may tailor 
the research or news we send you based on your investment profile or interests 
(for example, focusing on sectors you have invested in or topics you have shown 
interest in on our platform). This is done to enhance the relevance and 
usefulness of our research offerings for you.

                    Marketing and Promotional Purposes: With your consent (where required), we 
may use your contact details and certain profile information to inform you about 
new products, services, or promotions offered by FINTRA that might be of 
interest. For instance, we might send you emails or notifications about a new 
feature in our app, a new investment product, upcoming seminars or webinars, or 
special offers on margin loan rates. You have the choice to opt out of marketing 
communications as described in Section 10 (“User Rights and Choices”) below,

for their own marketing.

                    Service Improvement and Analytics: We analyze usage and technical data 
(including via cookies and similar tools) to understand how our customers use 
our digital platforms. This information helps us troubleshoot issues, improve the 
performance and user experience of our website and app, and develop new 
features. For example, we might track which features are most used or where 
users encounter errors, and use that insight to enhance those aspects of the 
platform. We may also use analytics to measure the effectiveness of our 
customer support and to ensure our security measures are working properly 
(such as identifying potential cyber threats). All analysis is done in aggregate or 
pseudonymized form whenever possible, and we do not use this data to make 
any automated decisions about you that would have legal or significant effects 
without human review.

                  <li>
                    Risk Management and Credit Assessment: In relation to our margin loan and 
financing services, we use personal and financial information to manage credit 
and risk. This includes assessing your eligibility for margin loans or credit limits 
(based on factors like your account equity, transaction history, and regulatory 
guidelines), monitoring your account for margin compliance (for example, 
ensuring sufficient collateral is maintained), and contacting you if action is 
needed (such as a margin call to deposit additional funds or sell securities). 
These activities are necessary for the prudent provision of financial 
accommodations and to protect both you and FINTRA from excessive risk. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Other Business and Legal Purposes: We may process your information for other 
legitimate business purposes, such as internal audits, financing and accounting 
operations, implementing business continuity plans, and maintaining records of 
business activities. If we need to use your personal data for a purpose materially 
different from those listed above, we will seek your consent or provide notice as 
required by law.

                </ul>
                <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mb-3">
                  We ensure that we have an appropriate legal basis for each use of your personal data. 
In most cases, the processing is justified by our need to fulfill a contract with you (e.g., 
providing the services you requested), to comply with a legal obligation, or to pursue our 
legitimate business interests (such as securing our platform or improving services) in a 
manner that does not override your privacy rights. Where we rely on your consent (for 
example, for optional marketing or certain data sharing), you have the right to withdraw 
that consent at any time as described in Section 10.

                    Essential Cookies: Some cookies are necessary for our website and trading 
portal to function properly. For example, they help authenticate your login session 
and keep you securely logged in as you navigate through secure areas of the 
site. They also enable core features like transaction processing and user 
preferences (such as language or interface settings). Without these cookies, 
services you have requested (like accessing your account or placing orders)

                    Analytics and Performance Tracking: We use cookies and tracking tools to 
understand how users interact with our website and app. For instance, we may 
use Google Analytics or similar services that set cookies to collect information 
about site traffic and usage patterns. This data includes details like which pages 
of our site are visited, how long users stay, how they arrived at our site, and what 
features of the app are used most frequently. We use this aggregated information 
to improve our platform’s functionality, performance, and user experience. These 
analytics cookies do not directly identify you but simply provide statistics that help 
us optimize our services.

                    Functionality Cookies: These cookies remember your preferences and enhance 
the personalization of your experience. For example, a functionality cookie might 
remember your chosen dashboard settings or your preference to see content in a 
certain layout. This way, you don’t have to reconfigure settings each time you log 
in.

                    Advertising and Marketing: As of now, FINTRA’s platforms are not used to display 
third-party ads, and we do not use third-party advertising cookies to target you 
with ads unrelated to FINTRA’s own services. If in the future we partner with 
advertising or social media networks for marketing campaigns, we will update 
this Policy accordingly. Any marketing-related tracking currently in use is limited 
to FINTRA’s own promotions (such as tracking the effectiveness of an email 
campaign by seeing if you clicked a link). We do not sell or share your browsing 
behavior with outside advertisers.

                </h2>
                <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mb-3">
                  FINTRA understands the importance of keeping your personal information confidential. 
We do not sell your personal data to third parties for their marketing purposes. However, 
in the course of running our business and as required by law, we may share your 
information with certain trusted parties, as outlined below: 
                </p>
                <ul
                  class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 hero-sub-text text-gray-300 ml-4"

                  <li>
                    Regulatory Authorities and Exchanges: As a licensed broker, we are legally 
obligated to share client information and transaction details with regulators and 
market institutions. This includes BSEC (for regulatory oversight), the stock 
exchanges where we operate such as the Dhaka Stock Exchange (and 
Chittagong Stock Exchange, if applicable), and the Central Depository 
Bangladesh Limited (CDBL) which manages your BO account and holds 
securities in electronic form. These entities may require information for purposes 
like market surveillance, compliance audits, or reporting of trade data. We only 
provide what is necessary and ensure that such disclosures are done under 
proper authority. Additionally, if required by the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence 
Unit or other government agencies for anti-money laundering or anti-terrorism 
financing monitoring, we will provide relevant data as mandated by law.  
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Banks and Financial Partners: When you link a bank account to your FINTRA 
account or engage in financial transactions, we share necessary information with 
relevant financial institutions. For example, we will share your account number 
and name with our partner bank when you initiate a fund withdrawal, or we may 
confirm your identity and account details with a bank when you deposit funds. In 
the context of margin or loan products, if we collaborate with a bank or financing 
partner to extend credit facilities, we might share some of your information (such 
as identification and credit-related data) with that partner strictly for the purpose 
of providing the service. In all cases, these institutions are themselves bound by 
confidentiality and data protection obligations under law and/or contract.   
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Service Providers and Vendors: We employ third-party companies and 
individuals to support our operations and services. This includes, for example: 
cloud hosting providers and data center services (to store and process data 
securely), IT support and software developers (who may work on our platform or 
provide tools we use), payment processors or payment gateway services (to 
handle online payments), identity verification services (such as platforms that 
verify NID or biometric data on our behalf), analytics and security service 
providers (who help us analyze data or monitor for fraud), and professional 
advisors (like auditors or legal counsel who may need to review certain records). 
These service providers are given access only to the information necessary to 
perform their specific tasks on our behalf. We require them to protect your 
information and not use it for any other purpose. They are contractually obligated 
to maintain confidentiality and comply with appropriate data protection standards.  
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Affiliates and Corporate Group: FINTRA Securities Limited is part of the broader 
Cotton Group, and there may be times when we share your information within 
our family of affiliated companies (for instance, a parent or sister company) for 
internal administrative purposes, centralized compliance management, or to 
facilitate services you have requested. Any such affiliate receiving your data will 
treat it with the same level of care and security as we do and will use it only for 
purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. If our corporate structure changes in 
the future (for example, through a merger, acquisition, or formation of new 
subsidiaries), we may share your data with the new or related entities as needed 
to continue providing services, subject to the same privacy safeguards.   
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Business Transfers: In the event that FINTRA undergoes a business transaction 
such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its 
assets, your personal data may be among the transferred assets. Should such a 
transfer occur, we will ensure that your information remains protected by 
requiring the acquiring entity to continue using your personal data in accordance 
with this Policy and applicable law. We will notify you (for example, via email or a 
prominent notice on our website) of any change in ownership or use of your 
personal information as a result of a business transaction, as well as any choices 
you may have regarding your information in that context.   
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Legal and Law Enforcement Purposes: We may disclose your personal 
information to governmental authorities, law enforcement agencies, courts, or 
other third parties when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is 
necessary to comply with a legal obligation. This includes responding to 
subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; cooperating with investigations 
(for example, providing information to law enforcement regarding suspected 
fraudulent or illegal activities related to our services); enforcing our account 
agreements or other contracts; or protecting the rights, property, or safety of 
FINTRA, our customers, or others. If we receive a request for your data that we 
believe we are not legally required to comply with, we will contest it as 
appropriate. In situations where the law allows, we will attempt to notify you of 
such requests before sharing your information, unless we are legally prohibited 
from doing so (for instance, by a confidentiality order or exigent circumstances).    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     With Your Consent or At Your Direction: In all other cases not covered above, we 
will not share your personal data with third parties unless you have given us 
explicit consent to do so. For example, at your direction, we might share your 
account information with a third-party financial app or advisor if you use such 
services and authorize the data connection. Similarly, if we ever wish to use your 
information in a way not covered by this Policy, we will seek your consent. You 
are in control of whether we disclose your information in these circumstances, 
and you can revoke your consent at any time.    
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mb-3">
                  We want to assure you that whenever your information is shared, we take steps to 
safeguard your data. We strive to anonymize or aggregate data before sharing when 
possible (for instance, providing market statistics that don’t identify individuals). All 
sharing is done on a need-to-know basis and in accordance with applicable 
Bangladeshi laws and regulations governing confidentiality and data protection.

                <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mb-3">
                  FINTRA primarily stores and processes personal data within Bangladesh. However, in 
today’s interconnected digital environment, some of your information may be transferred 
to, stored in, or accessed from jurisdictions outside of Bangladesh. For example, if we 
use cloud computing services or email service providers that have servers in other 
countries, or if our technical support team or vendors operate from overseas locations, 
your data might be processed in those locations.

                <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mb-3">

                  <li>
                    Contractual Safeguards: We require foreign service providers handling personal 
data to sign data protection agreements or contractual clauses that oblige them 
to protect your information to standards commensurate with Bangladeshi law and 
this Privacy Policy. These contracts typically include commitments such as 
maintaining confidentiality, implementing security measures, and using the data 
only for the purposes we specify. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Encryption and Security: We use strong encryption and security protocols when 
transmitting data internationally, reducing the risk that unauthorized parties could 
access your information in transit.   
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Jurisdictional Protections: In cases where data is transferred to countries that 
have robust data protection laws (for example, countries recognized for having 
GDPR-equivalent protections), we rely on those legal frameworks as an added 
layer of reassurance. If data is transferred to a country without similar privacy 
laws, we will ensure additional safeguards are in place or obtain your consent as 
required.   
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mb-3">
                  It’s important to note that different countries may have different laws and requirements 
concerning personal data. Regardless of where we process your information, we will 
continue to treat it in line with this Privacy Policy. Our data handling practices will not 
materially change just because your data is moved to another country. We remain 
accountable for its safety and use. </br>
By using our services or providing us with your information, you consent to the transfer 
of your personal data to countries outside of Bangladesh in the situations described 
above. If at any time Bangladesh enacts specific restrictions or conditions on cross
border data transfers (for instance, under a data protection law), we will comply with 
those conditions. This could include obtaining your explicit consent for certain transfers 
or meeting any regulatory notification requirements. </br>
If you have questions about international data transfers or want more information about 
where your data may be stored or accessed, you can contact us as described in the

                </h2>
                <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mb-3">
                  FINTRA retains personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it 
was collected, including for satisfying any legal, regulatory, or reporting requirements. In 
practice, this means:  
                </p>
                <ul
                  class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 hero-sub-text text-gray-300 ml-4"
                >
                  <li>
                    We will keep your personal and transactional information while your account is 
active and you are a user of our services. An “active” account means you have 
not requested deletion or closure and we believe you are still interested in our 
services (for example, you continue to log in or hold funds/securities with us). 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If you close your account or become inactive, we do not immediately delete your 
data. We will retain relevant information for a period of time thereafter as required 
by Bangladeshi law and regulatory guidelines. For instance, brokerage firms are 
subject to various record-keeping rules: the Companies Act 1994 and BSEC 
regulations mandate retention of certain business records, and anti-money 
laundering laws require retention of customer identification and transaction 
records for a minimum period (commonly at least five years after the end of the 
customer relationship or the date of a transaction). We adhere to these 
requirements by retaining data for the mandated durations.    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We also consider the statute of limitations for legal claims and the need to 
preserve evidence. For example, if a law allows customers to bring a claim 
against us within a certain number of years, we may keep relevant data until that 
period expires to protect against and address potential disputes.  
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Personal data that is no longer needed for any business or legal purpose will be 
disposed of securely. When deleting data, we follow documented procedures to 
ensure that the information cannot be reconstructed or read. In some cases, 
rather than deleting, we may anonymize your data (so it can no longer be 
associated with you) for analytical or statistical purposes, since anonymized data 
is not considered personal information and may be retained indefinitely without 
identifying you.   
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mb-3">
                  In summary, we retain your personal information only for as long as necessary. The 
exact time frames depend on the type of data and the specific laws or regulations that 
apply. Once the retention period is over, we will ensure that your data is erased, 
anonymized, or securely destroyed. </br>
If you have specific questions about how long a particular type of data will be retained, 
feel free to contact us. In certain cases, we might be able to honor requests to delete 
data sooner (for example, removing you from a marketing list) as long as we are not 
required to keep it. Refer to Section 10 on “User Rights and Choices” for how you can 
request deletion.

                  We take the security of your personal and financial information very seriously. FINTRA 
has implemented a range of administrative, technical, and physical safeguards 
designed to protect your data against loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, 
alteration, and destruction. These measures include, but are not limited to, the following:

                  <li>
                    Encryption: We use industry-standard encryption protocols (such as TLS/SSL) to 
protect data transmitted between your device and our servers. Sensitive data 
(like passwords, transaction details, and personal identification numbers) is 
encrypted in transit, and in many cases also encrypted at rest in our databases, 
so that even if data were to be intercepted or improperly accessed, it would be 
unreadable to unauthorized parties.

                  <li>
                     Access Controls: We restrict access to personal data strictly to authorized 
personnel who need that information to perform their job duties. Employees of 
FINTRA and our service providers are given access based on the principle of 
least privilege. We employ authentication measures (strong passwords, multi
factor authentication, biometric access controls, etc.) to prevent unauthorized 
access to our systems. Regular reviews are conducted to revoke access for 
those who no longer require it.    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Network and System Security: Our IT infrastructure is protected by firewalls, 
intrusion detection and prevention systems, antivirus and anti-malware solutions, 
and continuous monitoring of network traffic. We regularly update our software 
and systems to patch vulnerabilities and use advanced threat detection tools to 
identify and respond to suspicious activities.

                  <li>
                     Physical Security: The data centers and offices where personal data is stored are 
secured with appropriate physical controls. This may include 24/7 security 
personnel, CCTV surveillance, access card entry, biometric scanners, and 
secure server room environments with climate control and backup power. Only 
authorized individuals are allowed on premises where sensitive data is stored.   
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Security Policies and Training: We maintain comprehensive information security 
policies that align with industry best practices and regulatory requirements. Our 
staff receives training on confidentiality, data protection, and cybersecurity 
practices. We also perform background checks on employees where applicable, 
especially those handling sensitive financial data. Vendors handling data on our 
behalf are contractually required to uphold stringent security standards.    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Audits and Testing: FINTRA conducts periodic security audits, vulnerability 
assessments, and penetration testing (sometimes with the help of external 
experts) to evaluate the strength of our security measures. Any identified 
weaknesses are promptly addressed. We also maintain incident response plans 
so that we can react swiftly and effectively in the event of a security incident or 
data breach.     
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Data Backups and Recovery: We routinely back up critical data to prevent loss in 
case of system failures or disasters. Backup data is stored securely (with 
encryption and physical safeguards) and tested for integrity. In the event of a 
technical issue or natural disaster, we have business continuity and disaster 
recovery plans to restore services and data access with minimal disruption.     
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mb-3">
                  While we strive to protect your information with these robust measures, it’s important to 
note that no security system is infallible. Transmission of data over the internet, in 
particular, can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot warrant 
the absolute security of information during its transmission or storage in our systems. 
However, we continually update and improve our security practices to meet evolving 
threats. </br>
Your Responsibilities: You also play a vital role in keeping your data secure. We urge 
you to maintain the confidentiality of your account login credentials and to use unique, 
strong passwords for your FINTRA account. Implement any recommended security 
features we offer, such as two-factor authentication, to add an extra layer of protection. 
If you become aware of any unauthorized access or suspect that your account or 
personal data has been compromised, please contact us immediately so we can assist 
in securing your account. </br>
In the unfortunate event of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will 
follow applicable laws and regulations regarding notification. This may include informing 
you and relevant authorities within the required time frames and providing guidance on 
steps you may need to take to protect yourself.

                </h2>
                <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mb-3">
                  You have certain rights regarding your personal data held by FINTRA, as well as 
choices about how we communicate with you and use your information. We are 
committed to honoring these rights and providing you with control over your personal 
data. Below is a summary of your key rights and choices:
                </p>
                <ul
                  class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 hero-sub-text text-gray-300 ml-4"

                  <li>
                    Right to Access Your Information: You have the right to request access to the 
personal data we hold about you. Upon verification of your identity, we will 
provide you with a copy of your personal information in our records, as well as 
information about how we have used or disclosed it, as required by law. This 
helps you understand what data we have and confirm that we are processing it in 
accordance with the law.   
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Right to Correction: If any of your personal data with us is inaccurate or 
incomplete, you have the right to request that we correct or update it. We 
encourage you to review and update your account information (for example, 
contact details or identification documents) via our platform or by contacting us 
whenever changes occur, so we can keep our records current. We will promptly 
make the requested corrections upon verification.    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Right to Withdraw Consent: In situations where we rely on your consent to 
process your personal data (such as for sending marketing communications or 
for any optional data processing that is not strictly necessary for service provision 
or legal compliance), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. For 
example, you can opt out of receiving promotional emails or SMS by following 
the unsubscribe instructions provided in those messages or by contacting us 
directly. Please note that withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of any 
processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, and in some cases, 
withdrawing consent for certain uses of your data may limit our ability to provide 
you with the full range of services (for instance, if you withdraw consent for 
essential data use, we may need to close your account as described in Section 
11).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Right to Deletion (Right to be Forgotten): You may request that we delete your 
personal data under certain circumstances. For example, if you no longer have 
an account with us and believe there is no legitimate reason for us to retain your 
data, you can ask that it be erased. We will evaluate such requests in light of our 
legal obligations and retention policies. If we have no ongoing lawful basis or 
requirement to keep your information, we will delete or anonymize it. However, 
please understand that we cannot honor deletion requests for data we are 
required to maintain by law or for data critical to our legitimate interests (e.g., 
fraud prevention records) as long as those interests remain lawful and override 
your deletion request. We will inform you of the outcome of your request and any 
data we cannot delete and the reasons why.  
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Right to Object to Processing: In certain cases, you have the right to object to our 
processing of your personal data. For instance, if we were processing your data 
based on a legitimate interest (or for direct marketing purposes), and you feel 
that our use of your data is impacting your rights or freedoms, you can object to 
that processing. We will review objections and, if required by law, cease 
processing the data in question unless we have a compelling legitimate ground to 
continue or it is needed for legal claims. Currently, because comprehensive data 
protection laws are in the process of being implemented in Bangladesh, we 
extend this right in alignment with emerging best practices and will fully honor it 
as local laws become effective.  
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Right to Restrict Processing: You may have the right to request that we limit the 
processing of your personal data in certain situations. This can apply, for 
example, if you contest the accuracy of the data (while we are verifying it) or if 
you have objected to processing (while we determine whether our grounds 
override yours). During such disputes, you can ask that we halt further 
processing of your data (aside from simply storing it) until the issue is resolved.  
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Right to Data Portability: To the extent applicable under future data protection 
regulations, you might have the right to receive certain personal data in a 
structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to transmit that 
data to another service provider. For instance, if you decide to move to another 
brokerage and request a transfer of your personal data, we will assist in providing 
your basic account data in a convenient format, if technically feasible and legally 
required.    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Marketing Communications Choices: As mentioned, you can always choose not 
to receive marketing or promotional communications from us. If you prefer not to 
get such messages, you can click the “unsubscribe” link in the emails we send or 
reply with an opt-out request to SMS communications. You can also adjust your 
preferences in your account settings if that functionality is available, or contact us 
directly to be removed from our marketing lists. Please note, even if you opt out 
of marketing messages, we will still send you transactional or service-related 
communications (e.g., notices about your account, security alerts, confirmations 
of transactions) as these are necessary for our relationship with you.   
                  </li>
                  <li>
                       Cookies Preferences: As detailed in Section 5, you have control over cookies 
through your browser settings and any tools we provide. You can adjust your 
browser or device settings to refuse cookies or delete them. Additionally, if we 
utilize any optional cookies (like for certain analytics or personalization), we will 
offer you a way to opt out, either via a cookie consent banner or a settings page 
on our site. Keep in mind that essential cookies cannot be disabled if you wish to 
use our secure services (other than by not using the service), because they are 
fundamental to site operation.

                  <li>
                       Not Providing Data: You have the right to choose not to provide certain 
information. However, please be aware that refusing to provide information that 
we require to open or service your account (such as identification information or 
contact details) will likely result in our inability to offer you some or all FINTRA 
services. We will inform you when personal data is required to fulfill a contract or 
comply with a legal obligation, and what the consequences are if you do not 
provide it. For discretionary data fields, you can always choose not to fill them 
out.

                  Exercising Your Rights: To make any request related to your personal data or to 
exercise any of the rights outlined above, please contact us using the information in the 
“Contact Us” section (Section 15). We may ask you to verify your identity (for example, 
by providing identification or going through verification steps) before acting on your 
request, to ensure that we do not disclose data to the wrong person or make incorrect 
changes. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and in 
accordance with applicable law. In general, we will not charge a fee for processing your 
request, but if your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive (for example, 
repetitive requests), we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on 
the request as permitted by law. </br>
FINTRA is committed to upholding your rights and ensuring fair and transparent 
processing of your data. If you have any questions or need assistance regarding your 
rights and choices, do not hesitate to reach out to us.

                  11.  Consent and Account Closure 
                </h2>
                <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mb-3">
                  Consent to Processing: By using FINTRA’s services, creating an account, or otherwise 
submitting your personal information to us, you are consenting to the collection and 
processing of your data as outlined in this Privacy Policy. In certain cases, we may ask 
for your consent in a more direct manner (for example, by having you check a box or 
click “Agree”) especially if the law requires explicit consent for particular data practices. 
Where we rely on consent as the legal basis for processing your data, you have the 
right to withdraw that consent at any time (see Section 10 above). Please note, 
however, that withdrawing consent for essential processing may impact our ability to 
continue providing services to you. </br>
We also want to clarify that when you consent to this Privacy Policy, you are not only 
agreeing to current practices but also acknowledging that we may introduce new 
features or services in the future that align with the purposes described here. We will 
notify you and seek fresh consent if we ever intend to process your personal data for a 
purpose that is materially different from what is described in this Policy (unless it is 
otherwise permitted or required by law). </br>
Account Closure: You have the option to close your FINTRA account at any time, should 
you wish to discontinue using our services. The process for account closure may 
require you to submit a request through our platform or to contact our customer service 
with a written request. For security reasons, and to ensure it’s a genuine request, we 
will take steps to verify your identity and confirm your intent before closing the account. 
Before requesting closure, please ensure that any pending transactions are settled. If 
you have any outstanding obligations, such as negative balances, unsettled trades, or 
outstanding loans (for instance, an active margin loan), you will need to address those 
(through repayment or other arrangements) as part of the closure process. Account 
closure may be delayed or conditioned upon fulfilling these obligations in accordance 
with our customer agreement and regulatory requirements. </br>
Once your account closure is processed:
                </p>
                <ul
                  class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 hero-sub-text text-gray-300 ml-4"
                >
                  <li>
                    We will mark your account in our systems as “Closed” or inactive and cease any 
further processing of your personal data for active service provision. You will no 
longer be able to log into the platform or initiate transactions with that account.    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      We will stop sending you any routine service communications related to that 
account. However, we may still contact you for post-closure matters such as final 
statements, outstanding fee settlements, or required regulatory communications.     
                  </li>
                  <li>
                       As described in Section 8 (Data Retention), we will retain your data for a period 
after closure as required by law and internal policies. Closing your account does 
not immediately erase all your personal data from our records. Instead, your data 
will be archived and maintained securely until it is no longer needed. During this 
retention period, your information remains protected under the terms of this 
Privacy Policy. We will not use it for any new purposes – only for things like legal 
compliance, audits, or resolving disputes. Once the retention period expires, we 
will delete or anonymize the data as appropriate.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mb-3">
                  Importantly, if you withdraw consent for processing of your data, and that data is 
essential for us to provide the FINTRA service, we may interpret that withdrawal as a 
request to close your account (since we cannot provide our services without processing 
certain core data). We will inform you if this is the case and guide you through the 
account closure process. </br>
After account closure and once required retention periods lapse, we will permanently 
delete or anonymize the personal data associated with your account. If you ever decide 
to return to FINTRA after closing your account, you would generally need to create a 
new account and provide your details again, as we might not retain your previous 
details beyond what is legally required. </br>
We hope to have you as a long-term client, but we respect your choice to leave and 
your privacy rights in that process. If you have any questions about closing your account 
or need assistance, please contact us.

                  FINTRA is dedicated to addressing any concerns or disputes regarding your privacy 
and the handling of your personal data in a fair and prompt manner. If you have a 
complaint or believe that we have not complied with this Privacy Policy or applicable 
data protection laws, we encourage you to reach out to us so that we can work to 
resolve the issue. Here’s how disputes or complaints will be handled: </br>
Contact Us First: In the event of any grievance, please first contact our Data Protection 
Officer or the designated privacy team using the contact details provided in Section 15 
(“Contact Us”). Provide as much detail as possible about your concern (e.g., the nature 
of the issue, relevant time frames, and any supporting information). Our team will 
acknowledge your complaint and initiate an investigation. We may get in touch with you 
for further information if necessary. We aim to resolve most concerns through this direct 
communication, and we will inform you of the outcome or any measures taken to 
address your issue. </br>
Internal Review: FINTRA has internal procedures for investigating and resolving privacy 
issues. Complaints are reviewed by our compliance and legal teams, and if needed, 
escalated to senior management. We endeavor to provide a substantive response 
within a reasonable timeframe. This typically means within 30 days, though some issues 
(particularly complex ones involving technical investigations or third parties) might 
require more time. We will keep you updated on the progress if an answer cannot be 
given quickly. </br>
Regulatory Assistance: If you are not satisfied with our response or believe that we 
have not addressed your concerns adequately, you have the right to seek assistance or 
lodge a complaint with the appropriate regulatory bodies in Bangladesh. As of the date 
of this Policy, Bangladesh is in the process of enhancing its data protection governance.

regulated by BSEC, if your concern relates to how we handle client confidentiality 
or any violation of securities laws, BSEC can be apprised.

                  <li>
                        Bangladesh’s law enforcement agencies or courts – for serious matters such as 
data theft, fraud, or harm caused by misuse of data, you have the right to seek 
legal recourse. You may consult with a legal advisor on how to proceed in such 
cases.

                  We hope it never comes to this, but we want you to be aware of your options. We will 
cooperate fully with any official investigation or inquiry into our privacy practices, and if 
needed, abide by the decisions or directives issued by regulatory authorities or courts 
regarding the dispute. </br>
No Retaliation: Rest assured that raising a privacy concern or dispute will not affect the 
service we provide to you. We value feedback and view complaints as an opportunity to 
improve. You will not be discriminated against or refused services just because you 
have lodged a privacy-related complaint. </br>
Informal Resolution: Often, a quick call or email can clear up misunderstandings. We 
encourage you to reach out with any questions or issues, no matter how small, so that 
they can be resolved before escalating into disputes. Our customer support and 
compliance teams are trained to handle such matters sensitively and in accordance with 
applicable regulations. </br>
In summary, our goal is to maintain your trust. If we fall short, we are committed to doing 
our best to rectify the situation. Your privacy is of utmost importance, and we will take 
every complaint seriously.

              </h2>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mb-3">
              FINTRA operates under the laws of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. We are fully
              committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations concerning privacy,
              data protection, and financial services in Bangladesh. Below are key compliance points
              and the legal framework governing this Privacy Policy:
              </p>

              <li>
              <strong>Financial Regulations and Confidentiality:</strong>
              As a licensed brokerage house under BSEC, we abide by the securities laws and
              regulations of Bangladesh. This includes strict rules on client confidentiality.
              For example, Section 19 of the Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969 prohibits
              us from disclosing any information about a client’s account or transactions to
              unauthorized persons. FINTRA upholds these duties by ensuring that your personal
              and trading information remains confidential, and we only share it as permitted
              by law or as detailed in this Policy.
              </li>

              <li>
              <strong>Data Protection and Privacy Laws:</strong>
              Bangladesh is in the process of strengthening its data protection regime. We
              proactively align our practices with the principles outlined in the draft Personal
              Data Protection Ordinance, 2025 (PDPO), which, once fully enacted, will be the
              primary data protection law in Bangladesh. We treat your personal data in line
              with international best practices, including lawfulness, transparency, purpose
              limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, and
              confidentiality. As sections of the PDPO or related regulations come into effect,
              FINTRA will ensure full compliance, which may include enabling additional user
              rights or adjusting data handling procedures as required by law.
              </li>

              <li>
              <strong>Other Relevant Laws:</strong>
              We also comply with sector-specific and general laws related to information
              management. This includes the Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2012 and its
              amendments, the Cyber Security Act, 2023, the Information and Communication
              Technology (ICT) Act (to the extent applicable), and directives from Bangladesh
              Bank, BSEC, or other regulators regarding data security and customer
              confidentiality. If FINTRA handles special categories of data, such as credit
              bureau or taxpayer information, we strictly adhere to the laws governing those
              data categories.

              <strong>International Standards:</strong>
              In the absence of a fully enacted local data protection law, FINTRA voluntarily
              refers to international standards such as the EU General Data Protection
              Regulation (GDPR) as benchmarks for privacy protection. While not legally bound
              by GDPR for domestic operations, adopting similar principles helps ensure high
              standards of data security and respect for user rights, including for Bangladeshi
              expatriates or users subject to foreign data protection regimes.
              </li>

              <li>
              <strong>Audits and Oversight:</strong>
              Our compliance efforts are subject to oversight by relevant authorities such as
              BSEC, DSE, and other regulatory bodies. These authorities may audit our
              operations, including data handling practices, to ensure legal and regulatory
              compliance. We maintain detailed internal policies, records, and conduct regular
              internal audits to verify adherence to this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.
              </li>
              </ul>

              <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mb-3">
              Governing Law and Jurisdiction: This Privacy Policy and any disputes or claims arising 
                from it or related to your personal data are governed by the laws of Bangladesh. By 
                using our services, you agree that any legal action or proceeding concerning this Policy 
                or FINTRA’s handling of your information shall be brought in the competent courts or 
                tribunals of Bangladesh. In practice, this means if there is a need for litigation, it would 
                likely be handled by the courts of Dhaka (given that our head office is in Dhaka), unless 
                a regulator’s forum (like a tribunal or arbitrator specified by law) is available and 
                appropriate for the matter. </br>
                We note that, as privacy and data protection norms evolve, this Policy may be updated 
                to reflect new compliance requirements. FINTRA will always operate transparently and 
                ethically within the legal frameworks applicable to us. If you are reading this Policy at a 
                time when new laws have come into force, we appreciate your understanding as we 
                adapt to those laws and will update our commitments herein accordingly.

                </h2>

                <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mb-3">
                  We may revise or update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our
                  services, legal obligations, or data processing practices. When we make changes, we
                  will update the “last updated” date at the bottom of the Policy. If changes are significant,
                  we will take additional steps to inform you of these changes:
                </p>

                <ul

                  <li>
                    <strong>Posting on Website/App:</strong>
                    We will post the updated Privacy Policy on our website (and make it available
                    through our mobile app, if applicable). The new version will be effective as soon
                    as it is posted, unless otherwise stated. We encourage you to review our Privacy
                    Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Notification of Material Changes:</strong>
                    If we make any material changes that significantly affect your rights or the way
                    we handle your personal data, we will provide a prominent notice. This may
                    include notifications via email to the address associated with your account,
                    in-app alerts, or a pop-up notice when you log in. The notification will outline the
                    key changes and direct you to the revised Privacy Policy for details.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Consent for New Uses:</strong>
                    If any change to the Privacy Policy would permit us to handle your personal data
                    in a way that is materially different from that stated at the time of collection, we
                    will seek your consent for those new uses or offer you a choice before the
                    changes take effect, if required by law. For example, if we ever decide to collect
                    new types of data or share data with new categories of third parties not covered
                    by this Policy, we would obtain your consent as necessary.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Effective Date of Changes:</strong>
                    All updates to this Policy are effective when they are posted unless a later date
                    is specified. If you continue to use FINTRA’s services after a Privacy Policy
                    update takes effect, that will indicate your acceptance of the revised Policy.
                    However, if any changes require separate consent, your lack of response or
                    continued use won’t imply consent for those specific changes; we will explicitly
                    seek agreement in those cases.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="hero-sub-text text-gray-300 mb-3">
                  We maintain archives of previous versions of our Privacy Policy, which can be made
                  available upon request, so you can see how our practices have evolved over time. If
                  you have any questions about the changes or any aspect of the Privacy Policy, you
                  should contact us (see Section 15).
                </br>
                  In summary, FINTRA will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your
                  explicit consent. Our aim is to ensure that our privacy practices stay aligned with our
                  values, our clients’ expectations, and the legal requirements. We appreciate your
                  continued trust in us as we update our policies to serve you better.
